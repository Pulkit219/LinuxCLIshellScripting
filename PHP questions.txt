$a = 4;
for ($b = 0; $b <= $a; $b++) {
    $c++;

What is the value of $c ? 5 but c is not initialized anywhere



2)

$a[] = "a";
$a[] = "b";
$a[] = "c";

What is the value of $a[2] ? c



3)

$a = 200.5;
$b = 2005;
$c = "2005";

Which of the above variables type is integer ?   $b



4) 

$a = '1';
$b = &$a;
$b = "2$a";

What is the value of $b ? 21

Joe has created a variable with the space character (' ') for its name. Print the value of that variable.



6)

Is this a valid function declaration in PHP:

function foo($a, $a) {
    echo $a;
}



7)

// $_GET contains this:
$_GET['id'] = '1 OR 1=1';

$id = mysql_real_escape_string($_GET['id']);    
$sql = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $id";

Consider the code above. Will my query be safe against the injection attack?



8)

<?php

class A {

    static $ct = 0;

    public function __construct() {
        static::$ct++;
    }
}

class B extends A {

    public function foo() {
        echo static::$ct;
    }
}

class C extends A {

    public function foo() {
        echo static::$ct;
    }
}

$b = new B();
$b = new B();
$c = new C();

$c->foo();

What is the output of $c->foo()?



9)

<?php

namespace A;

class A {
    private $values  = array(
        'foo' => 0,
        'bar' => 1,
    ); 
}

$a = new A();
echo $a->foo . PHP_EOL;
echo $a->bar . PHP_EOL;
echo $a->zoo . PHP_EOL;

Change class A to implement the magic method __get so that it treats the indexes of
the private property $values as public properties. A call to $a->foo should return the
value of $this->values['foo'], for example.

When a call is made to a non-existent array index is made, throw an exception.



10)

Write a function that will multiply two integers together without using the * operator.
